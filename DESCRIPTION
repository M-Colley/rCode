Description: Built upon popular R packages such as 'ggstatsplot' and 'ARTool', this collection offers a wide array of tools for simplifying reproducible analyses, generating high-quality visualizations, and producing 'APA'-compliant outputs. The primary goal of this package is to significantly reduce repetitive coding efforts, allowing you to focus on interpreting results. Whether you're dealing with ANOVA assumptions, reporting effect sizes, or creating publication-ready visualizations, this package makes these tasks easier.
